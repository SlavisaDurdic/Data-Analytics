TASK i.e. WHAT HAVE I DONE?

- Collect data by downloading the CSV file from https://public.tableau.com/app/learn/sample-data?qt-overview_resources=1#qt-overview_resources.
- Connect to the file from Looker Studio and build visuals (https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/a1bc40e5-53c5-4355-8b86-33376083109c/page/jSoeD).

I have built pie, scorecard, line, and bar in combination with line charts. Those visuals show number of houses completed and/or sold in the US during the period 1963-2016, as well as overall average sale price and its value in time.
In order to better observe data, I've configured visuals as filters.
I was able to make some conclusions based on the visuals:
1) Home sale price had been increasing over time. Average price for the period 1963-2016 was $184.168,73.
2) Median of home sale price for the period 1963-2016 was $123.711,76.
3) Total number of sold houses during the period 1963-2016 was 35.080 thousands.
4) Total number of completed houses during the period 1963-2016 was 61.480 thousands.
5) The most houses for the period were sold on the south of the United States (=37.5%).
