TASK i.e. WHAT HAVE I DONE?

- Collect data by downloading the Excel file from https://public.tableau.com/app/learn/sample-data?qt-overview_resources=1#qt-overview_resources.
- Connect to the file from Looker Studio and build visuals (https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/5c23c74e-1648-473c-ac91-0db44aed4f29/page/p_dc9e2eplad).


*** Looker Studio Activities ***

The report is accessible through this Looker Studio link: https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/5c23c74e-1648-473c-ac91-0db44aed4f29/page/p_dc9e2eplad 
I have built table view and scatter, bar, treemap, map, and pie charts on three different Looker Studio pages. Those visuals show significant volcanic eruptions on Earth and the statistic such as number of missing, injured people, deaths and so by year, volcanic eruption name, country, and volcano explosivity index.
In order to better analyze data regarding number of deaths, I've configured visuals as filters on the Looker report page "Number of deaths metrics".
I was able to make some conclusions based on the visuals:
1) Ilopango – a powerful volcanic eruption of magnitude of 6, was the most tragic volcanic eruption in history with 30K deaths. It happened in 5th century in El Salvador.
2) Indonesia is the country with the most scored number of deaths due to volcanic eruptions – more than 55K deaths. The most serious one was called Kelut that counts more than 15K deaths. It happened on two different occasions (16th and 20th centuries).
3) Three strongest volcanic eruptions, measuring VEI of 7, were Tambora, Changbaishan, and Kikai. Tambora hit Indonesia in year 1815, and among those three, it is the only one with victims – 10K deaths.
4) Indonesia appears to be the area with most volcanic activities. Japan seems to be the second, and Iceland on the third place.
5) Area around Caribbean sea records the strongest volcanic eruptions on average.
