TASK i.e. WHAT HAVE I DONE?

- Download the 2022 PDF report from the companyâ€™s site: https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar22/download-center/index.html.
- Refer the income statement on (numerated) page 47 of the report.
- Connect to the report from Tableau and clean the data.
- Build visuals in Tableau (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/slavisadurdic/viz/MicrosoftPLStatement-PDFannualreport/PLDashboard).


*** Tableau Activities ***

I have built a few pages/worksheets which I have combined into one dashboard.
Tableau dashboard has been saved and published on Tableau Public page: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/slavisadurdic/viz/MicrosoftPLStatement-PDFannualreport/PLDashboard 
I have used the following: pie, table, and bar charts. Those visuals show values/numbers from the Microsoft income statement 2022 (however, as usually, financial statement amounts have been reported for years 2020, 2021, and 2022).
In order to observe data changes over the period, I've performed a few quick table calculations (I have calculated percent difference relative to a previous year and first year, as well as cumulative $ amounts).
I was able to make some conclusions based on the visuals:
1) 2Y growth rate of total revenue was 38.64% for the period 2020-2022 (~17.5-18 YoY % change).
2) On the other hand, 2Y growth rate of net income was 64.26% for the period 2020-2022.
3) Research and development makes ~1/5 of total costs.
