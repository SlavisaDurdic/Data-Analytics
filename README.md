# Data-Analytics
My portfolio of public dataset analysis/analytics.

This GitHub repository consists of python "template" scripts, and two main folders (PowerBI and Tableau).
Under these main folders there are many project folders. Each project folder is created for a specific dataset analysis, and mainly contains:
1) readme text file with detailed description about the project,
2) python script used to pull data from BigQuery and load it into a database,
3) Microsoft Power Point file with up to 10 slides that summarize the project,
4) Power BI file(s) or a Tableau link (within the readme file) as a BI tool for visualizing data,
5) other files, such as python files for hypothesis testing, regression analysis, or similar.
